Flux - 

Flux is an application architecture introduced by Facebook that provides a unidirectional data flow pattern for building 
scalable and maintainable web applications. It is not a library or a framework but rather a design pattern that helps 
manage the flow of data in an application.

Key Concepts of Flux:

1. Unidirectional Data Flow:

Flux enforces a unidirectional data flow, where data flows in a single direction through the application, 
making it easier to understand and debug.

2. Action:

Actions are payloads of information that describe changes in the application state. They are created by components and sent to the 
Dispatcher.

3. Dispatcher:

The Dispatcher is a central hub that receives actions and dispatches them to registered callbacks. 
It ensures that actions are processed in the correct order.

4. Store:

Stores contain the application state and logic for handling actions. They register with the Dispatcher to receive updates 
and emit change events.

5. View (React Components):

React components, or views, trigger actions based on user interactions. They listen for changes in the stores and update their 
presentation accordingly.Flux provides a clear separation of concerns and makes it easier to reason about how data changes 
in an application.
