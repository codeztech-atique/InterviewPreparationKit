In React, "props" is a shorthand for "properties," and it refers to the mechanism for passing data from a parent component 
to a child component. Props allow you to send information down the component tree, enabling communication between components.

Key points about props in React:

Immutable:

Props are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified by the child component that receives them.
Passing Data:

Data is passed from a parent component to a child component by setting attributes on the child component in the parent's JSX.


// Parent Component
<ChildComponent name="John" age={25} />
Accessing Props:

In the child component, props are accessed as an object.

// Child Component
const ChildComponent = (props) => {
  console.log(props.name); // John
  console.log(props.age);  // 25
  // ...
};

Dynamic Data:

Props allow you to dynamically change the content or behavior of a child component based on data from the parent.
Default Values:

You can define default values for props in case they are not provided by the parent component.

// Child Component with Default Values
const ChildComponent = (props) => {
  const name = props.name || 'DefaultName';
  // ...
};

Children as Props:

The special children prop is used to pass the content between the opening and closing tags of a component.


// Parent Component
<ChildComponent>This is the content</ChildComponent>

// Child Component
const ChildComponent = (props) => {
  console.log(props.children); // This is the content
  // ...
};
Props are a fundamental concept in React, facilitating the flow of data and communication between components in a React application. They contribute to the reusability and modularity of components, allowing for the creation of more flexible and maintainable code.
