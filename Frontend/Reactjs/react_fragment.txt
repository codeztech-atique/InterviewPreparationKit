What is React.Fragment, and why is it useful?

React.Fragment is a component in React that allows you to group multiple children elements without introducing an additional DOM element. 
It is particularly useful in situations where you want to return multiple elements from a component, 
but you don't want to create an unnecessary wrapper element in the DOM.

import React from 'react';

const ElementWrapper = () => {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <p>Child Element 1</p>
      <p>Child Element 2</p>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
};

export default ElementWrapper;
