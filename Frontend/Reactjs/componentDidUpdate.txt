What is the significance of the componentDidUpdate method?

The componentDidUpdate method in React is a lifecycle method that gets invoked after a component has been updated, 
which occurs following the initial render and subsequent re-renders triggered by changes in state or props. 
The primary significance of componentDidUpdate lies in its utility for handling side effects or executing additional 
logic that should occur after the component has been updated.


Key Significance:

1. Handling Side Effects After Update:

componentDidUpdate is often used to perform actions or side effects that are dependent on the updated state or prop values.

componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
  // Check if a specific prop has changed
  if (this.props.someProp !== prevProps.someProp) {
    // Perform actions based on the updated prop
    console.log('someProp has changed:', this.props.someProp);
  }

  // Check if a specific state has changed
  if (this.state.someState !== prevState.someState) {
    // Perform actions based on the updated state
    console.log('someState has changed:', this.state.someState);
  }
}

2. Updating the DOM After Changes:

componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
  // Access the updated DOM elements
  const updatedElement = document.getElementById('myElement');

  // Perform actions based on the updated DOM or trigger animations
  // ...
}
