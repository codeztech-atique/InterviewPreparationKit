React Router - 

React Router is a popular routing library for React applications that enables navigation and routing in a React application. 
It allows developers to create a single-page application (SPA) with multiple views and navigate between them while
maintaining a consistent user experience. React Router provides a declarative way to define the structure of the 
application and handle routing transitions.
