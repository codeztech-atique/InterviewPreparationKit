What is the significance of the render() method in React components?

Significance of render() Method in React:

Purpose: The render() method defines what will be displayed in a React component.
Return Value: It returns a React element, describing what the UI should look like at a given point.
Update Trigger: Any change in state or props triggers a re-render, invoking the render() method.
Immutability: React components follow immutability, and render() helps maintain a consistent UI state.
Virtual DOM: The result from render() contributes to the Virtual DOM diffing process, optimizing updates in the real DOM.
