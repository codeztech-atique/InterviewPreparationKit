Design a multi-publisher - multi-consumer which can stream in and out objects. This system should be able to handle more than 1 publisher and 1 consumer. Consumers should be able to reconnect to the system and seek from where they last connected. Consumers should've the choice of consuming from different publishers. Once all connected consumers have consumed data, the system should evict any data. Describe all the necessary classes, entities & efficient strategies required to come up with this system.ï»¿
