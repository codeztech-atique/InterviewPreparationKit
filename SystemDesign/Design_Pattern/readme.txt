/* TypeScript example that demonstrates all the concepts 

1. Classes & Objects
2. Interfaces
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism
5. Abstraction

Here you go â€” one-line definitions for each:

Classes & Objects â†’ A class is a blueprint, and an object is an instance created from that blueprint.

Interfaces â†’ An interface defines a contract of methods and properties that a class must implement.

Inheritance â†’ Inheritance allows a class to reuse and extend another classâ€™s functionality.

Polymorphism â†’ Polymorphism means the same method behaves differently depending on the object.

Abstraction â†’ Abstraction hides implementation details and exposes only the essential features.

ðŸ”‘ Breakdown:

Interface (Vehicle) defines a contract for all vehicles.
Abstract class (Engine) hides implementation details and forces subclasses to implement start().
Inheritance: ElectricCar extends Car.
Polymorphism: drive() behaves differently in Car and ElectricCar.
Classes & Objects: Car and ElectricCar are instantiated into objects (car1, tesla).
