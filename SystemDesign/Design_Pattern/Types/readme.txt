i) Creational Patterns (How books/libraries are created)
ii) Structural Patterns (How books/libraries are arranged)
iii) Behavioral Patterns (How books/libraries behave)

‚úÖ This way every pattern = Library & Book story.
You just imagine:

Creational = how we create/manage books.

Structural = how books/shelves/libraries are arranged.

Behavioral = how they act, notify, change, or process.

üéØ Top Design Patterns for Interviews

üèó Creational Patterns (How objects are created)

1. Singleton

When to use: When you need only one global instance shared across the system.

Real-world: Database connection pool, global config manager, metrics client.

Why asked: Tests understanding of managing global state, thread-safety, and hidden dependencies.

2. Factory (Factory Method / Abstract Factory)

When to use: When object creation logic should be abstracted from client code.

Real-world: DB client factory (MongoDB vs PostgreSQL), cloud storage providers (S3, GCS, Azure Blob).

Why asked: Checks if you know how to decouple creation logic and design extensible systems.

üèõ Structural Patterns (How objects are composed/arranged)

3. Facade

When to use: When you want to simplify a complex subsystem with a clean interface.

Real-world: Payment service that internally calls billing, notifications, and ledger services.

Why asked: Companies want to see if you can design APIs that make complex systems easy to use.

4. Decorator

When to use: When you need to add cross-cutting behavior without modifying the original code.

Real-world: Adding logging, caching, retries, or metrics around an HTTP service.

Why asked: Tests whether you understand extensibility without breaking existing code.

5. Proxy

When to use: When you need controlled access to an object (security, caching, rate-limiting).

Real-world: API gateway proxy, lazy-loading images in frontend, caching proxy in backend.

Why asked: Demonstrates thinking around scalability, performance optimization, and access control.

ü§ù Behavioral Patterns (How objects interact/behave)

6. Strategy

When to use: When you want to swap algorithms or business logic at runtime.

Real-world: Payment providers (PayPal, Stripe, Razorpay), caching policies (LRU, LFU), load-balancing strategies.

Why asked: Shows you can design for extensibility and avoid long if/else chains.

7. Observer (Pub/Sub)

When to use: When multiple systems/components need to react to a single event.

Real-world: Event-driven systems (Kafka, RabbitMQ, EventBridge), notification systems, webhooks.

Why asked: Checks if you understand decoupling via events, which is core to microservices and distributed systems.

8. Command

When to use: When actions should be represented as objects (to support undo, logging, retry).

Real-world: Task queues, job scheduling, audit logging, redo/undo functionality.

Why asked: Evaluates your ability to design systems with retryability, auditability, and history tracking.

üèÜ Key Takeaways

Creational ‚Üí How you make things (Singleton, Factory).

Structural ‚Üí How you arrange things (Facade, Decorator, Proxy).

Behavioral ‚Üí How things interact (Strategy, Observer, Command).

üëâ In interviews, they ask these because they map directly to large-scale systems you‚Äôll design as a Staff Engineer/EM.
