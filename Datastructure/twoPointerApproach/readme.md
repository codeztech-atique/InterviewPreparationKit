Approach:

Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning of the array (let's call it "left") and one at the end of the array (let's call it "right").

While the left pointer is less than the right pointer, do the following:

a. Calculate the sum of elements at the left and right pointers.

b. If the sum is equal to the target value, you've found the pair of elements.

c. If the sum is less than the target value, move the left pointer one step to the right (increasing the sum).

d. If the sum is greater than the target value, move the right pointer one step to the left (decreasing the sum).

Repeat the process until the left pointer is less than the right pointer. If you don't find a pair that sums up to the target value, you'll eventually exit the loop when the pointers meet (left > right).
